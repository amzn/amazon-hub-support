## How the service works
### Driver Delivery
A driver will arrive at your store to deliver parcels for Amazon customers who choose you as a pickup location. When the driver hands you the parcel, you need to scan each parcel label. Please scan delivered parcels as soon as possible. Your scan triggers the customer notification. The customer has 7 days to pickup the parcel.

#### What if I am busy?
